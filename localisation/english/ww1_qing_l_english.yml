 ww1_qing.289.d:0 "In March 1910, Wang Jingwei, a member of the Tongmenghui, was keen on raising popularity among the populace against the Qing. With their morale at an all time low after multiple failed revolutions since 1905, the assassination of Prince Chun, or Zaifeng, father of the emperor Puyi and current regent was being planned, with Wang Jingwei offering to sacrifice his life detonating the bomb.\n\nWhile Puyi resides safely within the walls of the Forbidden City, his father, the regent Zaifeng, travels often between his mansion and the palace. Wang intented to detonate a bomb on a bridge in between to kill Zaifeng and decapitate the imperial court. \n\nHis plan was foiled after the bomb was discovered. At first, it was suspected that the incident was the result of court intrigue, perhaps orchestrated by Yikuang, unhappy with Zaifeng's role as regent. However, investigators soon closed in on Wang and captured him. The only question now is, what is his fate?\n\nSummary: Tongmenghui Revolutionary Wang Jingwei attempts to assasinate the prince regent Zaifeng, fails and is captured. What is his punishment?"

She helped spy of the previous emperor for Cixi and helped block the 100 days reform in 1898. She adopted Puyi after he ascended the throne and was a major voice in our court. Her death has brought much disorganization to the court, and they have dropped many of the old squabbles with reformers that Empress Dowager Longyu held."

 ww1_qing.253.d:0 "In 1900, the United States were given a share of the Boxer Indemnities. Believing it to be too much, they offered to re-invest this into our country. Many plans were proposed, such as Yuan Shikai's infrastructure plan, but in the end, it was agreed that the indemnity would be reduced by $10.8 million on the condition it was used to setup a western style university. This university would be located on the site of the former imperial Tsinghua Gardens to form the new Tsinghua College, staffed by several prominent US and Chinese scholars such as Liang Qichao. \n\nThe agreement was approved in 1909 by Theodore Roosevelt and the US Congress and is now ready to be implemented."

They alleged that Yang had bypassed the provincial assembly and gained imperial permission to issue the debt directly. After much debate, the PCA decided that Yang did in fact overreach his powers and broke the law, and appealed to the Court for guidence in deciding the punishment. \n\nInstead, our Grand Council shocked the PCA by drafting an edict in the name of the Emperor outright refusing to punish Yang, only criticising him for being careless. The PCA is completely outraged, but powerless in the face of the Emperor's edict. What should we do?"
